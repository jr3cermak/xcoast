          This is xcoast 3.0, with some changes from xfig 3.x,
	  but still mostly derived from xfig 2.1.7a.


THINGS TO BEWARE OF:

1.  It requires ANSI C because there are function prototypes.

2.  It requires X11R4 or better and the Athena widgets.

3.  It takes coastline files in the format produced by the
    extract_coast Matlab program from the GSHHS database from GMT. The
    world_int.cst file is provided as an example.  It will still use
    the XCOASTDATA environment variable to find the coastline file,
    so make sure you update it.

4.  Files created with xcoast 2.0 can be read in with this
    version and will be converted to a version 3 format.

INSTALLATION

1.  Get world_int.cst file and put it somewhere.

2.  Set the environment variable in .cshrc (or whatever):

      setenv XCOASTDATA /mycoastlinedirectory/world_int.cst

3.  Unpack the xcoast sources.

4.  Build the Makefile and compile:

      xmkmf
      make depend
      make

    For Ubuntu, I had to install a bunch of packages:

    sudo apt-get install xutils-dev
    sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
    sudo apt-get install libxt-dev
    sudo apt-get install libxaw7-dev

5.  Become root and install:

      make install
      make install.man

    Otherwise, just copy the xcoast executable to some binary directory
    on your path.

6.  If you do not know xfig, it will help to read the manual:

      man xcoast

    or

      tbl xcoast.man | ptroff -man
